### What makes a Modern Web, taking into account not only the appearance? 

 ----> The Modern Programming Skills of Every Developer <----


# Perfomance 'Web/App in this Project'


## HTML 'Accesibility web' 

##### Web prepared for:
 
* Older and disabled persons, with assistive devices (voice assistance)
* People who have certain problems to move the mouse well.



## HTML Loading "lazy"

* Download images as needed is reducing the load on the server, if there were 20 30 40 images are not all loaded at time.
* They are loaded as the page is scrolled by the user.


## HTML 'Preload' 

* Stylesheet/css, fonts, etc, should be loaded as soon as possible, making a good experience when users are using our web/app.



## HTML 'Prefetch' 

What page do we want to load as soon as possible?

To know on which page to apply prefetch, I recommend: Google Analytics.
We first need to know which page users spend the most time on, and then prefetch that page.


## WebP 'Format"

* Using webp format, the load is very faster.
* Let say we use .jpg size 6 mb and webp with size 3mb, webp would almost always be half, there are exceptions, and surely is more faster.

#### But webp is not yet 100% supported in all browsers, like safari, but don't worry i have the key.

```bash

 <picture>
              <source srcset="img/blog1.jpg" type="image/webp" />
              <img loading="lazy" src="img/blog1.jpg" alt="imagen blog" />
            </picture>
            
```
			

**Label structure that in the case of not loading by webp, it would go to the next one, which would be the jpg.**			
			
			
## Modernizr 'Webp format'

## Meta 'Tags' 

```bash

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

What?


#### CSS Scroll Snap is a module of CSS that introduces scroll snap positions, which enforce the scroll positions that a scroll container's scrollport may end at after a scrolling operation has completed.



# SEO Ready 

### Why having an SEO Ready™ website is so important?
To a business, any size or type of website is an investment. Not having your business website built correctly from the beginning will result in a complete waste of time and money. It’s like building a restaurant in the middle of nowhere or printing flyers that will never be mailed.

Fact: If your website does not have the right content strategy or has not been originally programmed and built based on the latest search engine optimization techniques, it will be placed at the bottom of the pile.

Don’t just get a website, get an SEO Ready™ website that will gain the right positioning and visibility at the major search engines like Google™, Bing™, Yahoo™ and Ask.com™.

### Fact: All my websites are built SEO Compliant, Ready and Certified™ right from the start! I deliver the best of the latest technology in website development, security, usability and search engine compatibility.
